# Neural networks

Following Andrej Karpathy's Neural Networks [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ) in an attempt to understand them better. The objective is to build a Transformer model from scratch, and then go through Anthropic's research on [mechanistic interpretability.](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2023/monosemantic-features/index.html)

## micrograd

This repository attempts to build `micrograd`, a small autograd engine from scratch, using Python. I am following Andrej Karpathy's [micrograd tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0).
